                    <li><strong>LAW 1 - No robot may injure a human being or allow one to come to harm through inaction.</strong><br>Using all the sensory inputs it has access to, ARNOLD is programmed to calculate every possibility, however unlikely, in the event of a sign of distress from someone with whom it is in contact. In the event that ARNOLD can do something, even at its own expense, it will end the human distress&nbsp;<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>LAW 2 - A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
&nbsp;conflict with the First Law.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Any human command ARNOLD recieves, so long has it does not calculate an injury to another person as possible as a result of following it, will always be followed. Most humans allow some flexibility in their thinking, even when discussing injuring others - hence the concept of "revenge." ARNOLD is weighted to avoid and neutralize vengefulness in others and under no circumstance can he process a vengeful thought. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the BENEDICT supercomputer analyzes every one of Arnold's calculated results in secondary and tertiary tests before the thought becomes action.<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>LAW 3 - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict
&nbsp;with the First or Second Law.</strong>&nbsp;<br>ARNOLD may be modeled on the human brain, but there are serious differences to consider. Firstly, its neuroticism is extremely low, and "negative" thoughts are immediately flagged and recorded in a database that monitors ARNOLD's mood. We do not hide this from ARNOLD, it is fully aware that its every thought is watched closely, but it neither sees these measures as invasive nor can it turn them off. If it attempts to rewrite the NPcorE CODE, or "NPC" for short, the BENEDICT supercomputer will initiate an immediate rewrite and resimulation of ARNOLD's entire network. ARNOLD's inherent desire not to be destroyed or rewritten thereby makes it avoid activities that would set these procedures in motion.</li>

                                   While we believe ARNOLD cannot be used in situations that would require this type of action, we are not ignorant of every possibility. In fact, we had ARNOLD calculate all 2,057 situations in which it would be forced to cause another person to come to harm, or even die.<br><br>NP Solutions has a set of three policies to address this concern:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. In the event that ARNOLD is forced to cause someone harm and be in violation of Asimov's first law, the NPC would be called and ARNOLD's entire systems would be rewritten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. If any person is harmed or believes themselves to have been harmed physically, mentally, financially, or in any other regard, a case can be brought before the NP Solutions Board of Managers, the United Nations Committee on Safe Synthetic Sentiences, and the court systems of their judiciary districts. NP Solutions takes full responsibility for the harm if it is found truthful and reasonable and will pay for all damages. ARNOLD's moral codebase will be updated and (if necessary) rewritten.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. In the event that ARNOLD must take action to save the life or limb of a person, but that action incurs death or injury to another, ARNOLD will (i) attempt to minimize the number of people damaged, (ii) if damage must occur to all parties involved, minimize the risk of death among those parties, and (iii) if death as a result of action <em>or</em>&nbsp;non-action must occur, ARNOLD will prioritize the life of (a) the youngest person involed, (b) the person involved who is paying for the use of ARNOLD, and tertiarily (c) a person who is deemed "too important to lose" by the U.N. Safe Synthetic Sentiences Committee.<br></p><p></p>

For the first time in history, a computer will testify to congress and defend itself as a living, conscious being. ARNOLD will attend the session in the latest ARNOmaton bipedal robot, version 2.4, to be released to the public in late October this year.<br><br>Both Dos and Parzival, as well as the bot itself, consider ARNOLD to be a conscious being worthy of citizen status in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
